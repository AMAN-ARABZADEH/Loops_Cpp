# Loops in C++

This repository provides examples of loops in C++ to help beginners understand how loops are used and what can be achieved with them. 
Loops are essential constructs in programming that allow for the repetition of a block of code. 
They provide a way to iterate over data, perform calculations, control program flow, and more.

## Examples

The repository contains several examples that demonstrate different types of loops and their applications:

- **For Loop:** Iterates a block of code for a fixed number of times.
- **While Loop:** Iterates a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **Do-While Loop:** Executes a block of code at least once and then repeats as long as a condition is true.
- **Range-based For Loop:** Iterates over elements in a sequence (e.g., array, container) without using an explicit index.
- **Nested Loops:** Shows examples of nested loops and printing patterns.
- **Loop Control Statements:** Demonstrates loop control statements such as `continue` and `break`.
- **Loop with Vector:** Illustrates iterating over elements of a vector.
- **Performance Comparison:** Compares the performance of different loop types in summing numbers.
- **Menu-driven Program:** Shows how loops can be used to create interactive menu-driven programs.
- **Loop Algorithms:** Includes examples of loop algorithms such as searching and sorting.

Feel free to explore the examples and see how loops are used to solve various programming problems.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

2. Compile and run the C++ code examples using your preferred compiler:
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main

# Follow the instructions and observe the output of each example to understand the concepts and usage of loops.
